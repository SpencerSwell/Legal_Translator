						Legal person refers to a non-human entity 
						that is treated as a person for limited legal purposes--corporations, for example. 
						Legal persons can sue and be sued, own property, and enter into contracts. 
						In most countries, legal persons cannot vote, marry, or hold public office.
						Most countries also excluse legal persons from holding natural or constitutional rights, 
						such as the freedom of speech.
